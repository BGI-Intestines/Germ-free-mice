# Germ-free-mice

Here, we present a pipeline for a multi-organ single-cell, spatial transcriptomics, and bile acid omics atlas of SPF and GF mice.

This workflow includes the following contents,

1) Multi-organ single-cell integration
2) Multi-intestinal segment single-cell integration
3) Gut neighborhood analysis based on spatial deconvolution using cell2location
4) Calculation of metabolic pathway activity and statistical analysis
5) Liver zonation based on stereo-seq data
6) Multi-organ immune cell aggregation index analysis and plotting
7) Association of human GWAS and genetic disease data with  intestinal epithelial cell subtypes
8) Targeted bile acid statistical analysis
